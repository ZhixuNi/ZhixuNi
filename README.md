### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on Lipidomics data analysis and software development @ TU Dresden, Germany.
  + [Fedorova Research Group @ TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/med/mf/zml/forschungsgruppen/fedorova/mitarbeiter-innen-der-fedorova-gruppe)
- Some of our projects:
- + **[LMAI-TUD/LPPtiger2](https://github.com/LMAI-TUD/lpptiger2)**: LPPtiger2 2 is capable to perform *in silico* prediction of epilipidome, *in silico* fragmentation of epilipids, and identification of epilipids from LC-MS/MS lipidomics data. LPPtiger 2 also have the function to generate inclusion list for PRM experiments. LPPtiger 2 generates interactive HTML output with its unique six-panel-image, which provides an easy way to review, store, and share the identification results.

  + **[SysMedOs/LipidHunter 2](https://github.com/SysMedOs/lipidhunter)**: LipidHunter 2 is capable to perform bottom up identification of lipids from LC-MS/MS and shotgun lipidomics data by resembling a workflow of manual spectra annotation. LipidHunter generates interactive HTML output with its unique six-panel-image, which provides an easy way to review, store, and share the identification results.

  + **[SysMedOs/LipidLynxX](https://github.com/SysMedOs/LipidLynxX)**: LipidLynxX provides the possibility to convert, cross-match, and link various lipid annotations to the tools supporting lipid ontology, pathway, and network analysis aiming systems-wide integration and functional annotation of lipidome dynamics in health and disease.
